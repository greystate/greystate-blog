Tools & Resources
=================

Over the years I've produced a chunk of "tools" that I refer
to from time to time, so I've gathered them here - who knows;
you might find one of them useful too :)

## [Object Builder [redux]][OBJRDX]

I built this as a way to quickly mock up an object or two
and to be able to grab the stubbed-out code as a start.

[OBJRDX]: /resources/objredux/


## [Maximum Request Length Calculator][MAXLEN]

A tool for users of Umbraco (or .NET really?) to calculate the
numbers needed to punch into the configuration file, when you
need to allow a certain size for uploads.

[MAXLEN]: /resources/umbraco/maxrequestlength/


## [Umbraco Razor Quick Reference][RAZREF]

My own format for quick reference of Razor as used in Umbraco.

[RAZREF]: /resources/umbraco/razor-reference/


[Subtree Merge][SUBMERGE]
-------------------------

This tool comes in handy when you need to pull part of one Git
repository into another.

[SUBMERGE]: /resources/subtree-merge/
