# About me

I'm a frontend developer from Denmark doing mostly content sites with [Umbraco CMS][UMB].

I'm co-owner of [Voksev√¶rk][VV], a design and development bureau in Aarhus, Denmark.

## Experience

Over the years I've had the pleasure of working with a bunch of different technologies,
including (in no particular order):

* HTML & CSS
* XML, XPath & XSLT
* Less (CSS pre-processor)
* JavaScript
* CoffeeScript

Also, I've had the (sometimes) pleasure (and sometimes horror) of trying out all of
these solutions for managing content (aka [CMSs][PLURALIZE]):

* Dynamicweb
* Sitecore
* Wordpress
* Synkron VIA
* Ziteman
* Umbraco CMS

(Again, in no particular order)

After having had to bend my frontend code in horrible ways to adapt to the output of
any given system's "Master Template" (or equivalent otherwise named *base output*),
I finally found Umbraco in circa 2009 and haven't looked away since.

What's rendered by Umbraco is of my own doing - not someone else's.
