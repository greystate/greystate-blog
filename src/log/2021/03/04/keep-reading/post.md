I Hope To Keep Reading
======================

Oh hi!<br>
I've decided to try to read **one book every month** in 2021 — I know, some people
go through a book every week, but that'll definitely not be me for any
foreseeable future. Also, I'm talking about real books here - not ebooks or
audio books - but the nice, slightly worn paperback kind that just speaks to
you, lying there on the tabletop…

We'd been watching “The Queen's Gambit” last year, and I decided to put the book
(by Walther Tevis) on my Christmas/birthday wishlist, and got it (my birthday's
between Christmas and New Year's so it's always been a bit of a blur). I read
through it in January and liked it very much - a great supplement to the series,
actually.

I also think I just liked reading again, and as I finished right around the end
of January, I figured I could try grabbing another one from the shelf and keep
at it all through February as well?

I chose “Jurassic Park” by Michael Crichton — I read it a year or two after the
movie came out and remembered it was pretty good. It was a great read this time
again and I definitely want to see the film again very soon.

March has arrived and I kinda feel like I'm going to revisit a lot of books I
read as I was younger. I found “The Silence of the Lambs” by Thomas Harris and
dug right into it. I vividly remember listening to the soundtrack LP (score by
Howard Shore) while reading this the last time. I read it in Danish then, but
somehow we've acquired an English copy at some point, which is the one I'm
reading now.

Anyway, let's see if I can manage to write another post around April and we'll
see which book I'm reading then, shall we?
