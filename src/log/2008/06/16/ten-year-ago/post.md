# 10 Years Ago, Today

I can't believe it's actually been *ten years* since I entered the stage at Train, Aarhus
with two of my very good musical friends Tove & Johan, to play my final exam concert
from "The Royal Academy of Music, Aarhus" - after four years of studying it was quite a
relief to get onstage and just *play*...

A couple of personal highlights included opening *the show* with
*What-A-Girl!* (my instrumental tribute to the one and only) and getting
to perform [Steve Vai][SV]'s "Die To Live" for a bunch of musicians who had
for too long been engulfed in the world of Jazz and music theory. Hehe - just kidding :-)

I know, I know - it would only be appropriate to provide you with some evidence,
and I'm working on it - I'll put a couple of MP3's up later, but for now: Cheers!
