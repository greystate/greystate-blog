Sometimes you need to *Think!*
==============================

At [work][JAPP] I have the explicit luxury of using a 30″ Cinema Display, which has *a lot*
of space for timestealing apps, widgets & whatnots, so I’ve begun to use a real gem
of an app, that makes me focus just a *little* better on the task at hand — it’s called
[Think][THINK], and it works by highlighting the app you’re currently using, dimming the surrounding
screen real estate to your preferred color (and transparency!).

I like simple stuff like that.

**Update, October 2019:** The original link no longer works, but I found [another link][THINK2] and tried installing it
on macOS Mojave (10.14.6) which -- surprisingly -- still works! (You'll need to specifically allow opening it
and it will no longer work in macOS Catalina for sure, because of the switch to requiring apps to be "64 bit").
