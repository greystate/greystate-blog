# Sometimes you need to *Think!*

At [work][JAPP] I have the explicit luxury of using a 30″ Cinema Display, which has *a lot*
of space for timestealing apps, widgets & whatnots, so I’ve begun to use a real gem
of an app, that makes me focus just a *little* better on the task at hand — it’s called
[Think][THINK], and it works by highlighting the app you’re currently using, dimming the surrounding
screen real estate to your preferred color (and transparency!).

I like simple stuff like that.
