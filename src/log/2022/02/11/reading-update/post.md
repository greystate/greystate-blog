An Update On The Reading Situation
==================================

<time data-slug="reading-update" datetime="2022-02-11T21:50:00">11 Feb, 2022</time>

I wrote a post in March last year about my intent of reading a lot more than I'd
been doing lately. Conside this a late follow-up :)

After **“The Silence of the Lambs”**, I spent April reading **“Ready Player One”**
by Ernest Cline — a rather fantastic story that I'd heard a lot about. I enjoyed
that very much and subsequently watched the Spielberg film. I enjoyed the film
too and didn't really have a problem with the many changes made (it was a crazy
project to film this story in the first place).

In May I read an old favorite of mine - **“Watchers”** by Dean R. Koontz. I love
this story - it's super suspenseful and hard to put down. Which is also why I
managed to cram an extra title into May; I had received the screenplay for my
favorite movie **“The Prestige”** - written and directed by Christopher Nolan. I'll
definitely be reading more screenplays of movies I know well.
